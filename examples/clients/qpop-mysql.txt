Follow the instructions in the patch on how to apply it.

Build Qpopper. Here's the command line I used to configure mine before
building.  Adjust the paths to match your system.

=== Sample settings for ./configure ===

./configure \
  --with-popperconfig=/etc/qpopper.config \
  --enable-mysql \
  --with-mysqlconfig=/etc/mysql-popper.conf \
  --with-mysqllibpath=/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql \
  --enable-shy \
  --enable-servermode \
  --with-openssl \
  --enable-maildrop-type=maildir
=======================================

Leave out "--with-openssl" if you won't be supporting secure
connections.

This build is for use via inetd.  If you would prefer a standalone
daemon, include the switch "--enable-standalone".

Use the sample mysql-popper.conf file but change the login name and
password used to access the mysql database.
